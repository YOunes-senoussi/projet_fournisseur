try these urls:
  - GET "get_all_client_credentials/" (for testing only)
  - GET "get_all_store_credentials/"  (for testing only)

  - GET "secure_view/":
    - for testing only.
    - right now this is the only secure API endpoint.
    - we'll secure all other endpoints whenever you want to.
    - to access this endpoint you have to enclude an auth token in the header of the request.
    - the token should be included in a header called "Authorization", ex.:
      "Authorization": "Token f98c258e584212c24645d60f7ac2ea67260f9e8c"


  - POST "client_log_in/" body: {"phone_number", "password"}
  - POST "store_log_in/"  body: {"phone_number", "password"}

to listen for notifications you must connect to one of these sockets:
  - ws: "client_notification/"
  - ws: "store_notification/"

  - ex: "ws://127.0.0.1:8000/store_notification/"

  - these sockets are secure, meaning you must provide 
      an auth_token the same way as in http requests.
  - if you try to connect to the clients socket then 
      the token you provide must belong to a client (same with stores).

  - the server uses the token to determin the user who connected to the socket.
